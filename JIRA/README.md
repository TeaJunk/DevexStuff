+ Added regex filename pattern generator to match all old tickets. 
+ Added a bit of polish to the script


-----
jiracheck 0.1

Basic implementation.
Asks api for each ticket since by default jira will return just 20 tickets, and this solution is universal (but slow)


-----
Mostly, some bash scripts

Some test
